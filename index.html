            <p> For a web developer, an IDE (Integrated development environment) is an absolute must! <br> Since there is a whole lot of software available on the market, it is very important that you find one that fits your style of coding...</p>

            <h1>Why</h1> 
            <p>As an anonymous woman once said &#128070;</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p> "Make time <strong>now</strong> to do it <strong>right</strong> or make time later to do it over."</p>

            <h1>Information</h1>
            <p>An IDE is more than a simple text editor. While code-centric text editors such as <i>Sublime</i> of <i>Atom</i> offer many convenient features such as syntax highlighting, customizable interfaces and extensive navigation tools, they only allow you to write code. To make functioning applications, you at least need a compiler and a debugger.An IDE includes all of these components and then more. Some IDEs come with additional tools for automating, testing and visualizing the development process. The term “integrated development environment” means that you have everything you need to <b>turn code into functioning apps and programs</b>.Which is the best IDE on the market? The better question is: “Which is the best IDE for my purposes?” General factors to consider when choosing the best IDE include the languages it can support, ease of use and cost.</p>

            <h1>Which one to choose</h1>
            <p>I chose Visual Studio Code, and it looks like this <br>

            <p>I have chosen Visual Studio Code, because it promises to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>combine the simplicity of a source code editor with powerful developer tooling: </li>
                        <ul>   
                            <li>such as IntelliSense code completion (which will suggest possible completions based on your typed characters) to ease your work</li>  
                            <li>and debugging,</li>
                        </ul> 
                    <li>support macOS, Linux and Windows:</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>so you can go for it, no matter the platform,</li>
                        </ul>
                    <li>support Git:</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>so you can work with source control without leaving the editor,</li>
                        </ul>
                    <li>customize every feature to your liking.</li>
                </ul>
            <p> It is also commonly used so if I encouter any problems I can google my way out of them.</p>
